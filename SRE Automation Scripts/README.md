# SRE Automation Tools

This repository contains a collection of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) tools for automation. These tools are designed to help reduce toil and improve efficiency in managing and monitoring systems.

## Python Scripts

This section contains Python scripts for automating various tasks:

### Script 1: Filesystem Monitor

A Python script that monitors the available space on mounted filesystems and provides warnings when free space falls below a specified threshold. It retrieves information about mounted filesystems using the `df` command and allows users to set custom free space thresholds.
