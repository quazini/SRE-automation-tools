# File: cortex_latency_slo.yaml
# 
# Description: PromQL query for Cortex Latency SLO
# This query calculates the percentage of responses within the specified latency threshold (190.73 ms)
# over the last hour, compared to the total number of responses in the same timeframe.
#
# Usage: This query can be used in Prometheus or compatible monitoring systems to track
# the performance of a Cortex cluster.
